# Codex Auth Profile Isolation (`ccsx auth`)

Run two Codex accounts simultaneously — one per terminal — with full auth isolation.

## Why

Codex stores its OAuth credentials in a single directory (`~/.codex/`). When you run two
`codex` sessions in separate terminals, they both write to the same `auth.json`. A token
refresh in one session overwrites the other's credentials.

`ccsx auth` solves this by giving each account its own profile directory under
`~/.ccs/codex-instances/<name>/`. Each profile holds its own `auth.json` and
`history.jsonl`. A shared `config.toml` is linked via symlink so model/provider settings
stay in sync.

## Quick start (4 commands)

```bash
# Create and authenticate two profiles
ccsx auth create work       # creates ~/.ccs/codex-instances/work/ and prompts for login
ccsx auth create personal   # same for personal account

# Activate per terminal (ephemeral — only this shell)
# Terminal A:
eval "$(ccsx auth use work)"
codex

# Terminal B:
eval "$(ccsx auth use personal)"
codex
```

## Two-terminal example

```bash
# Terminal A — work account
eval "$(ccsx auth use work)"
codex                         # runs with CODEX_HOME=~/.ccs/codex-instances/work

# Terminal B — personal account (simultaneously)
eval "$(ccsx auth use personal)"
codex                         # runs with CODEX_HOME=~/.ccs/codex-instances/personal

# No token clobbering. Each session refreshes its own auth.json only.
```

## Command reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ccsx auth create <name>` | Create profile dir + auto-login |
| `ccsx auth login <name>` | (Re-)authenticate an existing profile |
| `ccsx auth switch <name>` | Set the persistent default profile for future `ccsx` launches |
| `ccsx auth use <name>` | Emit shell exports for this shell only (use with `eval`) |
| `ccsx auth show [name]` | List all profiles or show details for one |
| `ccsx auth remove <name>` | Delete profile dir + registry entry |
| `ccsx auth import-default <name>` | Migrate legacy `~/.codex/auth.json` into a new profile |

## Persistent vs ephemeral switching

| Method | Scope | How |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `ccsx auth switch <name>` | Future `ccsx` launches | Writes to `~/.ccs/codex-profiles.yaml` |
| `eval "$(ccsx auth use <name>)"` | Current shell only | Sets `CODEX_HOME` + `CCS_CODEX_PROFILE` in your shell |

Native `codex` shells only see the persistent default when launched through the `ccsx`
Codex runtime. For an already-open shell or a plain native `codex` binary, use `auth use`.

Shell syntax for `use`:

```bash
# bash / zsh
eval "$(ccsx auth use work)"

# fish
ccsx auth use work | source

# PowerShell
ccsx auth use work | Invoke-Expression
```

## Migration from `~/.codex`

If you already have a logged-in session in `~/.codex/auth.json`, import it without
disturbing the original:

```bash
# Auth only (default — recommended)
ccsx auth import-default legacy

# Auth + history + sessions (opt-in)
ccsx auth import-default legacy --with-history

# Make it the default
ccsx auth switch legacy
```

The source `~/.codex/` directory is **never modified**. If `import-default` is not run,
`codex` continues to work exactly as before.

### Torn-write safety

Codex writes `auth.json` with truncate+write (not atomic rename). Running
`import-default` while a token refresh is in flight can produce a corrupt copy.
The command detects a running `codex` process via `pgrep` and refuses unless you
pass `--force-while-running`. The safest approach is to quit Codex before
importing.

## Dashboard

The CCS dashboard shows active profile metadata at the **Auth Profiles** tab on the
Codex page:

- Profile name and whether it is the current default
- Decoded email address (from `id_token` — no signature verification; display only)
- Plan tier (Plus, Pro, Free) when present in the token
- Last-used timestamp

No OAuth tokens are ever returned by the API endpoint or shown in the UI.

## Profile disk layout

```
~/.ccs/
├── codex-profiles.yaml          # Registry: version, default, profiles metadata
└── codex-instances/
    └── <name>/
        ├── auth.json            # OAuth credentials (Codex writes here)
        ├── history.jsonl        # Per-profile prompt history (optional)
        ├── sessions/            # Per-profile chat session dirs (optional)
        └── config.toml -> ~/.codex/config.toml   (symlink — shared)

~/.codex/
└── config.toml                  # Single shared model/provider config
```

## Caveats

### Windows symlinks

On Windows, creating symlinks requires Developer Mode or elevated privileges.
If symlink creation fails, CCS falls back to copying `config.toml`. In this case,
changes to `~/.codex/config.toml` are **not** automatically reflected in the profile —
you must re-run `ccsx auth create <name> --force` to refresh the copy.

### `ccsx` vs `ccsxp`

`ccsx auth` profiles apply only to the **native `codex`** CLI. They have no effect on
`ccsxp` (the CLIProxy round-robin pool). `ccsxp` unconditionally sets its own
`CODEX_HOME` on startup and ignores `CCS_CODEX_PROFILE`.

If you run `eval "$(ccsx auth use work)"` and then invoke `ccsxp`, a notice is emitted
to stderr:

```
[i] CCS_CODEX_PROFILE is ignored by ccsxp; profile applies to native 'codex' only
```

### cmd.exe

`ccsx auth use` emits `set FOO=bar` syntax for cmd.exe. Native `eval` is not available
in legacy cmd — use PowerShell (`Invoke-Expression`) instead.

### Backup files from `--force`

When re-importing with `--force`, the existing `auth.json` is backed up as
`auth.json.bak-<timestamp>` in the profile directory. These accumulate over time; remove
them manually when no longer needed.
